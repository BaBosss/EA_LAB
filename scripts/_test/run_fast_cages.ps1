.SYNOPSIS
    ORDER-420. Runs every cage that is fast enough to sit in the pre-commit hook, and
    names the ones that are not.

.DESCRIPTION
    The guards in scripts\check_*.ps1 are enforced on every commit by .githooks\pre-commit.
    The TESTS for those guards were enforced by nothing at all. Every suite under
    scripts\_test\ was manual-only, which is the same condition ORDER-270 diagnosed --
    "a cage that never runs protects nothing" -- except it applied to the whole directory
    rather than one slow script.

    That gap is not theoretical. In eight days this repo shipped four separate defects where
    a guard kept running and quietly stopped reporting: ORDER-260 (substring match),
    ORDER-341 (advisory label outranking the blocking one), ORDER-390 (nested backticks),
    ORDER-370 (a pipeline .Count that is $null for exactly one result). Each was found by a
    human looking, not by a suite.

    MEASURED 2026-07-27, which is what decides the split (times are per suite, cold):

      run_statusclass_tests.ps1          0.5s   -> FAST, runs here
      run_order_collision_tests.ps1      0.9s   -> FAST, runs here
      run_handoff_contract_tests.ps1     0.9s   -> FAST, runs here
      run_blobmap_encoding_tests.ps1     1.3s   -> FAST, runs here
      run_mris_asof_tests.ps1            0.8s   -> FAST, runs here (added 2026-07-27, ORDER-434)
      run_chainwalk_tests.ps1           74.4s   -> too slow for a hook, run before release
      run_order101_negative_tests.ps1   ~120s   -> too slow for a hook
      run_order103_negative_tests.ps1   ~760s   -> too slow for a hook
      run_order105_negative_tests.ps1   520.8s  -> too slow for a hook, AND currently RED
                                                   (ORDER-421: two real-hook zero-byte cases,
                                                    pre-existing, cause not yet known)

    WHY A TIME BUDGET IS PART OF THE DESIGN, NOT A COMPROMISE
    A hook that costs 10 minutes gets bypassed with --no-verify, and then it protects
    nothing while looking like it protects everything. That is strictly worse than an
    honest 4-second hook plus a named list of what it does not cover. So this script
    refuses to grow: if a suite here ever exceeds $BudgetSeconds total, it says so loudly
    rather than silently becoming the thing people skip.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER -- read this before trusting a green run:
    the four slow suites above, and in particular run_order105_negative_tests.ps1, which
    exits 1 today (ORDER-420 STEP 2 owns finding out why). Green here means "the four fast
    cages passed", nothing more.

.PARAMETER BudgetSeconds
    Total wall-clock the fast tier is allowed. Exceeding it is reported as a warning with
    the per-suite breakdown, so the split above gets revisited with numbers.
