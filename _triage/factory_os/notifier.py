"""
notifier.py - ORDER-1180 (slice S12). The direct Telegram sender and the Morning Brief.

WHAT THIS IS
  The alert path, end to end, with ONE hard seam in the middle:

    LOCAL SIDE   observe() and plan(). Has the verified snapshot, the finding journal and the
                 internal finding ids. Computes the dedupe key - INCLUDING material_revision,
                 which is not on the SafeProjection and therefore cannot be computed from it.
                 Runs the KNOWN-SECRET scan, which only this side can run, because only this
                 side has the snapshot the secret list is derived from.

    SENDER SIDE  deliver(). Has AlertEvents and nothing else. Obtains the projection through
                 safe_projection.read_for_sender() - the one reader - and never sees the
                 snapshot. It cannot leak what it was never handed.

  design 7.3 rev 3 fixed the seam and this file is the seam made real:
  "Telegram and the online page read only the SafeProjection, and the sender has no path to the
  full snapshot at all."

THE PROHIBITION THAT DISARMS ITS OWN CHECK, AND WHERE IT LANDS HERE
  S11 found it the hard way: taking the snapshot away from the sender emptied the KNOWN_SECRET
  layer of scan_forbidden(), because that layer's input IS the snapshot. S11 answered on the
  sender side by checking the SHAPE against schemas.json. S12 answers on the OTHER side as well:
  the planner still has the snapshot, so assert_sendable() runs the full scan WITH the real
  secret list before an event is ever handed across the seam. The two halves check different
  things - shape on the far side, literals on the near side - and neither is a substitute.
  (memory: prohibition-disarms-its-own-check)

FOUR THINGS design 10 REQUIRES OF THIS SLICE, and where each one lives
  1. Alerts work with OpenClaw stopped        -> openclaw_state() MEASURES it and the ledger
                                                 records what was observed next to the receipt.
                                                 imports_of() proves the path cannot reach it.
  2. Dedupe on severity AND material_revision -> dedupe_key(), and observe() is what produces a
                                                 material_revision at all.
  3. A per-channel delivery ledger            -> Ledger, (dedupe_key, channel, outcome, receipt).
  4. One recovery, escalation never swallowed -> control_center.fold_finding, CALLED not copied.

WHAT THIS FILE REFUSES TO DO
  - It builds no second projection and opens no second snapshot reader. safe_projection owns both.
  - It computes NO drawdown, no percentage, no threshold. design 7.1: "the dashboard creates no
    competing threshold". Today every dd_pct_band reads UNKNOWN because no detector publishes
    one, and the Morning Brief says exactly that instead of deriving a number.
  - It never returns a benign default for an input it does not recognise. An unrouted severity,
    an unknown reason code and an unreadable process list are each a STATED failure. A sender
    that cannot send and reports nothing is indistinguishable from a quiet fleet.
